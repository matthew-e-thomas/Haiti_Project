# Haiti_Project
A machine learning project to find survivors of the 2010 Haiti earthquake

This is a project I did for my MS program. It uses image data taken from planes after the Haiti earthquake to try to locate 
survivors who need help. It tries to identify blue tarps, which were used by survivors to indicate they needed help.

In this project, I use caret to compare several different models including logistic regression, linear discriminant analysis,
quadratic discriminant analysis, knn, support vector machines, and random forest to see which model gives the best results.
